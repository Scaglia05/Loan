Check the possibility of a loan

This Python script allows users to check the possibility of getting a home loan based on the desired home value, monthly salary, and intended payment period. Here is an overview of how the code works:

The program asks the user to enter the value of the desired house (vc), the monthly salary (s) and the payment period in years (a).
Calculate the value of the monthly installment by dividing the value of the house by the total number of payment months (a * 12).
Then, calculate 30% of the monthly salary (s*0.3), representing the maximum portion that can be committed to the loan.
If the value of the monthly installment is less than or equal to 30% of the salary, the program prints "Approved", determining that the loan is approved.
Otherwise, the program prints "Denied", indicating that the loan has been refused.
This roadmap is useful for those who want to quickly assess their ability to obtain a home loan based on their personal finances and the value of their desired property.
